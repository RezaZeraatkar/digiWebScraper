# digiWebScraper
I wrote this scraper app just for doing some research in the area of Natural Language Processing(NLP). it scrapes the digikala website **smoothly through rotating proxies and engines so the targeted website cann't detect this is a bot with some randomly time lags** from homepage navigating into each product page and gets all the info related to that product including **name of the product, stars, price, descriptions, comments and more**. **it may not work now due to some platform and api changes** in digikala marketplace as it's written a long time ago.
